## rust electron yew demo

example of building a rust based web app (yew) into a native app using electron.

First `make setup` once to get the node dependencies.
then run with `make run` or build a native app bundle with `make bundle` (**~150mb**).

Looking for something more lightweight: [rust-webview-todomvc-yew](https://github.com/Extrawurst/rust-webview-todomvc-yew) (**~2mb**).
